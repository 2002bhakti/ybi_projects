## Introduction
The Movie Recommender System aims to enhance the user experience by suggesting movies that users are likely to enjoy. It leverages collaborative filtering to find similarities between users and content-based filtering to analyze movie attributes.

## Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender-system.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd movie-recommender-system
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To use the project, you can run the training script or use the pre-trained model for recommendations.

### Training the Model
To train the model with the default configuration, run:
```bash
python src/training/train.py --config config/config.yaml
```

### Making Recommendations
To make movie recommendations for a user, run:
```bash
python src/recommend.py --user_id 123
```

```

## Datasets
The dataset can be downloaded from [MovieLens](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/). Place the downloaded files in the `data/raw/` directory.

To preprocess the data, run:
```bash
python src/data/preprocess.py
```

## Model Training
To train the model, use the following command:
```bash
python src/training/train.py --config config/config.yaml
```
This script will read the configuration file and start the training process.

## Evaluation
To evaluate the model, run:
```bash
python src/evaluation/evaluate.py --model_path results/model.pth
```
This script will load the trained model and print evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, and RMSE.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set. Below are some visualizations of the results:
